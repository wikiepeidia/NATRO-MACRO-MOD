7. Hive hub macro

Installion:[![NatroMacro](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-HIVEHUBMACRO-black?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)](https://github.com/huner2/NatroMacro/tree/hub_field_addition)  

Pattern reccomedation: 
![NATRO MACRO MOD](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wikiepeidia/NATRO-MACRO-MOD/refs/heads/main/image/3.jpg)

Notice: Apply ROBLOX image search fix due to very old version.Drift a lot and  no one willing to find a pattern

Application for Image fix [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/Discord-Image%20Fix-5865F2?style=for-the-badge&logo=discord)](https://discord.com/channels/1012610056921038868/1305695364845928620)

Usage: AFK stickers, hive hub stamp, leaderboard, hive hub badge.

![NATRO MACRO MOD](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wikiepeidia/NATRO-MACRO-MOD/refs/heads/main/image/4.png)

Tool reccomedation: dark scythe.

Attention: Currently there is glitch to place petals,POP or planters in the hub field. 

While we could not find any true case of data being wiped for doing this, as of now, do not macro in the hub, since the owner can perform statistic revert,etc.

Also it might be possible to be flagged, thus we do not recommend an unfair play. 

8. RDP Setup

Problem: Roblox cant run on virtual machine due to no GPU passthrough.Hyperion does not like Vmware SVGA,etc

here is what you can do before :

![NATRO MACRO MOD](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wikiepeidia/NATRO-MACRO-MOD/refs/heads/main/image/10.webp)

![NATRO MACRO MOD](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wikiepeidia/NATRO-MACRO-MOD/refs/heads/main/image/12.png)
Solution: usage of RDP,lighter than the whole OS, but less stability.

![NATRO MACRO MOD](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wikiepeidia/NATRO-MACRO-MOD/refs/heads/main/image/11.png)

Application installion: rdp wrapper sebaxakerhtc  

![NATRO MACRO MOD](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wikiepeidia/NATRO-MACRO-MOD/refs/heads/main/image/15.jpg)

Notice: unsure some browser CHROME flag `github.com/sebaxakerhtc/rdpwrap/` site as dangerous.This tool is much more updated with support for Automatic ini and patching files, as well as screen resoution change.

 If you do not like this RDP consider traditional way [![Google Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/Google%20Docs-Open%20Document-4285F4?style=for-the-badge&logo=googledocs&logoColor=white)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13Sx3mtLNRYVYAcTIRCjPcK41OygrBKOZg6mw-vfNTnQ/edit?usp=sharing)


Running 2 ACCS for best error free:

Acc main installion Bloxstrap, find code at `natromacro.ahk` 
```ahk
 ; if roblox exists, activate it and send Esc+L+Enter
 ```
replace the code below to 
```ahk

....................REST CODE....................
        Sleep 4500 ; Delay to prevent Roblox Error Code 264
    }
    ; Kill only Bloxstrap version
    for p in ComObjGet("winmgmts:").ExecQuery("SELECT * FROM Win32_Process WHERE Name LIKE '%Roblox%' OR CommandLine LIKE '%ROBLOXCORPORATION%'")
    {
        ExecutablePath := p.ExecutablePath
        if (ExecutablePath && !(InStr(ExecutablePath, "Bloxstrap"))) ; Skip non-Bloxstrap versions
            continue
        ProcessClose p.ProcessID ; Kill Bloxstrap version of Roblox
    }
}
```

Acc alt installion normal roblox, edit the same location to
```ahk
 
....................REST CODE....................
        Sleep 4500 ; Delay to prevent Roblox Error Code 264
    }
; Kill only the default-installed Roblox versions (ignoring Bloxstrap)
    for p in ComObjGet("winmgmts:").ExecQuery("SELECT * FROM Win32_Process WHERE Name LIKE '%Roblox%' OR CommandLine LIKE '%ROBLOXCORPORATION%'")
    {
        ExecutablePath := p.ExecutablePath
        if (ExecutablePath && InStr(ExecutablePath, "Bloxstrap")) ; Skip Bloxstrap version
            continue
        if (ExecutablePath && !(InStr(ExecutablePath, "Program Files") || InStr(ExecutablePath, "AppData"))) ; Skip non-default installs
            continue
        ProcessClose p.ProcessID ; Kill default-installed Roblox versions
    }
}
```

if run more accs, consider use Bloxstrap all accs since it is guranteed to install on `%localappdata%` then apply code for both accs. 

The codes are not tested. Check for yourself

```ahk
; Kill only Bloxstrap for the current user
	CurrentUser := A_UserName
	LocalAppDataPath := "C:\Users\" CurrentUser "\AppData\Local\Bloxstrap"

	for p in ComObjGet("winmgmts:").ExecQuery("SELECT * FROM Win32_Process WHERE Name LIKE '%Roblox%' OR CommandLine LIKE '%ROBLOXCORPORATION%'")
	{
		ExecutablePath := p.ExecutablePath
		if (ExecutablePath && !InStr(ExecutablePath, LocalAppDataPath)) ; Skip if not the current user's Bloxstrap
			continue
		ProcessClose p.ProcessID ; Kill only this user's Bloxstrap version of Roblox
	}
}
```
recommendation resulution: 1366x768, for honeyday consider full HD. 

for 1366x768, recommended full screen to avoid inactive honey issues. Small taskbar if you do not want full screen.

to get small taskbar on windows 11 consider:

if you want virtual machine, consider finding a way to GPU passthrough. Hyperion wants GPU, means you would somehow be able to install your GPU driver inside the vm.

Considering some solution

[![VMware GPU Passthrough](https://img.shields.io/badge/VMware-PCIe%20Passthrough-607078?style=for-the-badge&logo=vmware&logoColor=white)](https://us.informatiweb-pro.net/virtualization/vmware/vmware-esxi-6-7-pci-passthrough.html)

Disadvantage: any time attempting to run multiple roblox macro on a PC would consume extreme power.

9.  Reduction loops for vicious bee `natromacro.ahk`

Usage: if good attack, can reduce errors detection wrong with stick bug's totem, timing errors with vicious bee,etc

Loop fields (How many time attempt the vic,especially after dying, can be glitched)

```ahk
Loop 10 ; attempt each field a maximum of n (10) ;reduce loop lower
```

Time wait for attack: sometime can get error in attack and stand in a field for 10 minute

```ahk
if((nowUnix()-VBLastKilled)<(600)) { ;it has been less than 10 minutes since VB was found
```
10. Changement of the Title and icon, Themes.

![NATRO MACRO MOD](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wikiepeidia/NATRO-MACRO-MOD/refs/heads/main/image/7.jpg)

title: `natromacro.ahk`
```ahk 
MainGui := Gui((AlwaysOnTop ? "+AlwaysOnTop " : "") "+Border +OwnDialogs", "Natro Macro (Loading 0%)")
```

```ahk
SetLoadingProgress(percent) => MainGui.Title := "Natro Macro (Loading " Round(percent) "%)"
```

```ahk 
MainGui.Title := "NaAAAtro Macro"
```

icon:

locate `/nm_image_assets/auryn.ico`

Usage icon maker, converter website: [![Favicon.io](https://img.shields.io/badge/Favicon.io-Icon%20Maker-orange?style=flat-square&logo=googlechrome&logoColor=white)](https://favicon.io/)


theme:

Download functional themes at  [![Visual Styles](https://img.shields.io/badge/Visual%20Styles-Download%20Themes-blue?style=plastic&logo=paintbrush&logoColor=white)](https://www.skin-soft.co.uk/visualstyles/skingallery.aspx)


If you want a classic DEFAULT theme, either remove the `/nm_image_assets/styles/` or download a non functional theme such as [![Windows Aero](https://img.shields.io/badge/Windows%2011%20Aero-Download%20MSStyles-black?style=social&logo=windows&logoColor=blue)](https://www.deviantart.com/thetechnoguy18/art/Windows-11-aero-msstyles-for-Windows-10-906211554)

Default theme has trouble with UI compared to with themes. this could be issues with AHK 2.0 UI selection, AHK 1.0 is perfect with default theme.

11. additional feature from developer version to version does not have that feature yet

to hand on one of the developer versions  please join natro macro server [![natro macro](https://img.shields.io/discord/1012610056921038868?logo=discord&logoColor=white&label=Discord&labelColor=black&color=5865f2)](https://discord.com/channels/1012610056921038868)

**‚ö†Ô∏èAttention: do not leak any of the developer version.**

in this case, version 1.0.0.3 is newer than version 1.0.1 developer beta. this is more like windows neptune 5111 versus windows xp 2600. 

we will not provide code for this section due to privacy issue but we will provide tips whether possible to transfer

Attention: we just recieved a warning from natro macro to not leak any informations. thus we will no longer provide anything here

If you are using that developer beta versions, consider everything is  DIY. 

For supports, only channels that is granted with the access to the pre release will help you.

leaking anywhere else could result in terminations,blacklist and etc..

concepts: if you want anything yourself, consider study where the functions and assets at.
